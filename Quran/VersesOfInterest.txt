From the study of both the bible and quran I have found them to be radically different in that their beliefs do not align.
Here are the main points and differences between them:
    -The bible teaches that you go to sleep when you die and you do not go to heaven, neither do you go to an everlasting burning fire to burn forever.
        -The quran teaches that believers go to heaven where they get recliner chairs, a server that brings whatever food or drink they want and God makes new beautiful virgin women that they get to enjoy forever, while non-believers upon death inherit eternal burning in fire in which it states God will renew their skin so that the sensation of burning never goes away. It also states that the believers will go and be able to mock the non-believers as they suffer.
    -The bible teaches that the reason satan fell was because he was puffed up and wanted to be the most high.
        -The quran teaches that the reason why satan fell was because he would not bow and worship adam a man that God created, but all the other angels bowed and worshipped adam. This is not written at all in the Bible.
    -The bible teaches Christ was the Son of God, and came to be as the passover lamb was for Isreal in Egypt to save them from death but instead Christ was to save the whole world from death by the forgiveness and sacrifice of his life for all mankind.
        -The quran teaches that Christ is not the Son of God. It even states that God the Father has no one to reproduce with so how could He have a Son? The quran also states that Christ was not killed but that it was all an illusion and that he just went back up to heaven instead of dying.
    -The old testemant was written hundreds of years before the quran.
        -The quran being the youngest book and having little to nothing in common with the writing of the prophets of the old testemant yet will say that it is in agreement with the prophets and even Christ Himself, it is as if the writer of the quran never read the old testemant or new testemant.
    -The new testemant from Christ is about forgiveness and to do no violence to anyone but to live with love for God and your fellow man.
        -The quran teaches the contrary it speaks of condemntation, and to kill non believers.


2:34 - And We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam." They bowed down, except for Satan. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.

2:47-49 - O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and I that favored you over all nations.
And recall that We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you terrible persecution, killing your sons and sparing your women. Therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.

2:55-56 - And recall that you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you unless we see God plainly." Thereupon the thunderbolt struck you, as you looked on. Then We revived you after your death, so that you may be appreciative.

2:81 - Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and becomes besieged by his iniquities-these are the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will dwell forever.
    In the Quran it mentions many times that non-believers are inmates of fire forever, yet in the bible there is no search verses which describe God giving eternal life and having you burn forever.

2:154 - And do not say of those who are killed in the cause of God, "Dead." Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive.

2:190-191 - And fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not commit aggression; God does not love the aggressors.
And kill them wherever you overtake them, and expel them from where they had expelled you. Oppression is more serious than murder. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque, unless they fight you there. If they fight you, then kill them. Such is the retribution of the disbelievers.
    -The writer of the quran states that Christ is from God and a prophet, but yet proceeds to go against the teachings of Christ, Christ said if a man hit you give him your other cheek and to do no violence to any man, yet here it is written to kill aggressors.

2:249-251 - When Saul set out with the troops, he said, "God will be testing you with a river. Whoever drinks from it does not belong with me. But whoever does not drink from it, does belong with me, except for whoever scoops up a little with his hand." But they drank from it, except for a few of them. Then, when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, "We have no strength to face Goliath and his troops today." But those who knew that they would meet God said, "How many a small group has defeated a large group by God's will. God is with the steadfast." And when they confronted Goliath and his troops, they said, "Our Lord, pour down patience on us, and strengthen our foothold, and support us against the faithless people." And they defeated them by God's leave, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as He willed. Were it not for God restraining the people, some by means of others, the earth would have gone to ruin. But God is gracious towards mankind.
    -This is an interesting one, he takes the story of Gideon in the old testemant and makes it Saul. Then he proceeds to butcher the story of when David killed Goliath as none of the things written here are from the original story. These story written hundred of years before the writer of the quran and written from the descendants of Israel.

2:260 - And when Abraham said, "My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead." He said, "Have you not believed?" He said, "Yes, but to put my heart at ease." He said, "Take four birds, and incline them to yourself, then place a part on each hill, then call to them; and they will come rushing to you. And know that God is Powerful and Wise."
    -Another story that was never mentioned in the bible, and this one seems out of character for Abraham, for in the bible Abraham was most faithful and did not ask God for signs to believe in Him.

3:3 - He sent down to you the Book with the Truth, confirming what came before it; and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.
    - States that the Torah and the Gospel is from God, yet contradicts the teaching in them.

3:15 - Say, "Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who are righteous, with their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will remain forever, and purified spouses, and acceptance from God." God is Observant of the servants.
     - Mentioning of the purified spouses.

3:28 - Believers are not to take disbelievers for friends instead of believers. Whoever does that has nothing to do with God, unless it is to protect your own selves against them. God warns you to beware of Him. To God is the destiny.

3:33-36 - God chose Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran, over all mankind. 
     - Mentions Imran in here and hes not recorded anywhere in the scriptures of God. Even tries to say Christ descended from Imran.

3:55 - God said, "OJesus, I am terminating your life, and raising you to Me, and clearing you of those who disbelieve. And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return; then I will judge between you regarding what you were disputing.
     - Completely anti-Christ

3:67 - Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a Monotheist, a Muslim. And he was not of the Polytheists.
     - Claiming Abraham was a muslim when the word did not exist until the early 1600s, Jew comes from Judah which is a later descendant of Abraham and Christian was after Judah and the term Jew was used. Abraham would not call himself a muslim as it does not align with the prophets of God whatsoever.

3:85 - Whoever seeks other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.

4:3 - If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the orphans-then marry the women you like-two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then one, or what you already have. That makes it more likely that you avoid bias.
    - Said like a true poet. Take a few wives or not.

4:14 - But whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, and oversteps His bounds, He will admit him into a Fire, wherein he abides forever, and he will have a shameful punishment.

4:34 - Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, as God has given some of them an advantage over others, and because they spend out of their wealth. The good women are obedient, guarding what God would have them guard. As for those from whom you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, then strike them. But if they obey you, seek no way against them. God is Sublime, Great.
     - Advocates for hitting your wife if you suspect her to be disloyal. Thats not at all in the Bible.

4:55 - Among them are those who believed in it, and among them are those who held back from it. Hell is a sufficient Inferno. Those who reject Our revelations-We will scorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins are cooked, We will replace them with other skins, so they will experience the suffering. God is Most Powerful, Most Wise. As for those who believe and do good deeds, We will admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. They will have purified spouses therein, and We will admit them into a shady shade.
     - God will renew their burning flesh so they can keep suffering and the believers get purified spouses to sit in the shade with.

4:157 - And for their saying, "We have killed the Messiah,Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger ofGod." In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they did. Indeed, those who differ about him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it, except the following of assumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.
      - The prophets of old spoke of Christs coming and his sacrifice, Christs own disciples wrote of it. Yet this writer puts that he did not die and that he was not the Lamb that came to cleanse mankind which was written hundred of years before his birth but proceeds to spew out this trash.

5:31 - Then God sent a raven digging the ground, to show him how to cover his brother's corpse. He said, "Woe to me! I was unable to be like this raven, and bury my brother's corpse." So he became full of regrets.

5:33 - The punishment for those who fight God and His Messenger, and strive to spread corruption on earth, is that they be killed, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, or be banished from the land. That is to disgrace them in this life; and in the Hereafter they will have a terrible punishment.

5:72 - They disbelieve those who say, "God is the Messiah the son of Mary." But the Messiah himself said, "O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever associates others with God, God has forbidden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. The wrongdoers have no saviors."
     - Christ himself said he was the I AM that spoke with Moses. Claiming to be God and stating that he and His Father are one. These words are not from Christ but are from satan himself and he has authored a book of confusion.

5:75 - The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger, before whom other Messengers had passed away, and his mother was a woman of truth. They both used to eat food. Note how We make clear the revelations to them; then note how deluded they are.

5:116 - And God will say, "OJesus son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Take me and my mother as gods rather than God?'" He will say, "Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my soul, and I do not know what is in your soul. You are the Knower of the hidden.

6:100-101 - Yet they attributed to God partners-the sprites-although He created them. And they invented for Him sons and daughters, without any knowledge. Glory be to Him. He is exalted, beyond what they describe. Originator of the heavens and the earth-how can He have a son when He never had a companion? He created all things, and He has knowledge ofall things.
          - Here it is stating God the Father doesnt have a mate so he could not have a Son.....

7:11-13 - We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam;" so they bowed down, except for Satan; he was not of those who bowed down. He said, "What prevented you from bowing down when I have commanded you?" He said, "I am better than he; You created me from fire, and You created him from mud."

7:44 - And the inhabitants of the Garden will call out to the inmates of the Fire, "We found what our Lord promised us to be true; did you find what your Lord promised you to be true?" They will say, "Yes." Thereupon a caller will announce in their midst, "The curse of God is upon the wrongdoers."

7:50 - The inmates of the Fire will call on the inhabitants of the Garden, "Pour some water over us, or some of what God has provided for you." They will say, "God has forbidden them for the disbelievers."
     - No where is any of this taught in the bible, even though sunday christians believe in an everlasting burning hell where people suffer forever, a teaching taught by the catholic church it is not in the bible and is not true.
