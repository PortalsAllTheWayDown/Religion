They shall beat their swords into plowshares, nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.

Micah 5:2 - He come forth out of Judah that is to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.

Micah 6:7 - Is God pleased with great sacrifices? He shows you, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.
