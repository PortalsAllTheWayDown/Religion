Haggai 1:1 - The word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest. Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying , This people say, the time is not come, the time that the Lords house should be built.
Should you dwell in your cieled houses and this house lie waste?
Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house, and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified saith the Lord.
Zerubbabel obeyed the voice of the Lord.
Haggai 2:21 - In that day will I take thee O zerubbabel, my servant, I will make thee as a signet for I have chosen thee saith the Lord of hosts.
