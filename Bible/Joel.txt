Joel 2:1- The day of Lord cometh, for it is at hand. A day of darkness.

Joel 2:12 - Turn unto me with all your hearts with fasting and with weeping. Rend your heart and not your garments. For God is mercifel and full of kindness.

Joel 2:30 - The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible day of the Lord. It shall be that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.

Joel 3:14 - Multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.
    This is similar to the valley in revelations 16:16 Armageddon or revelations 14:20 And the winepress was trodden and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles.
