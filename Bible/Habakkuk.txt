Habakkuk 3:3 - God the Holy One from mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. His brightness was as the light. Before him went pestilence and burning coals went forth at his feet.
He stood and measured the earth. He drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow. his ways are everlasting.

Habakkuk 3:16 - That I might rest in the day of trouble.
