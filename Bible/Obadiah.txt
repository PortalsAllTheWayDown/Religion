Obadiah 1:3 - The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the cleft of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, who shall bring me down to the ground?
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will i bring thee down, saith the Lord.

Obadiah 1:18 - The house of Esau for stubble.
