Genesis Notes

Genesis 1:26 Man made in the image of God, but this is mentioned before Adam, but it does mention Adam as the first in the bible. Interesting thing is were other men created without a certain spirit from God and is this where Cain got a wife from?

Genesis 2:7 God creates Adam.

Genesis 3:20 Eve mother of all the living.

Genesis 4:14 Cain says "everyone that findeth me shall slay me." God puts a mark on Cain, who is he talking about when he says everyone?

Genesis 5:22 Enoch walked with God.

Genesis 6:4 Sons of God had children with the daughters of men making giants, me of great renown. Could this be the angels? Also did these angels genetically modify their children to make them stronger and bigger? If fallen angels did indeed walk along side men and had children then did they also build the pyramids? And gave men certain advancements in technology?

Genesis 7:12 Noah, it rained for 40 days and 40 nights.
    -Matthew 4:1-11 Jesus fasted 40 days and forty nights.
    -Exodus 24:18 Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
    -Exodus 34:28 Moses was there with the Lord for forty days and forty nightsl he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
    -Deuteronomy 9:9 Moses did abide in the mount forty days and forty nights, not eating or drinking and this time these tablets were written with the finger of God.
    -1 Kings 19:8 Elijah ate and drank, from that meal he went in strength for forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.


Genesis 10:8 Nimrod founded the city of babel. From babel was the mystery religion formed. This religion had the mother on nimrod Semiramis who was also known as Ishtar, which is prnounced Easter, Ishtar claimed to get pregnant and that it was the rays of the sun-god baal that caused her to conceive. From the teachings in the bible it seemed that if satan knew that Christ was to come from a virgin birth that this false religion imitated it to discredit the future events of Christ being born from a virgin birth as the idea would not have been original but a duplicated event.

Genesis 14:18 Melchizedek King of Salem brought forth bread and wine, mentioned as the High Priest of the most high God.
    -Psalm 110:4 Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
    -Hebrews 7:1 For this Melchisedec, kind of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham...7:3 without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life' but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

Genesis 15:18 The Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

Genesis 17:9 God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

Genesis 22:12 Abraham was willing to sacrifice Issac unto God, Just as the Father God did with His Son Jesus Christ for all of mankind to be redeemed by his blood.

Genesis 18:11 Jacobs pillow stone, he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the eath, and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to they seed. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
    - Stone of Scone, there is a belief that this stone is actually the pillow stone of Jacob, and that the kings of England would get coronated on this stone. Monarchs sat on the stone of scone itself. It is said that the bloodline of David was moved over to Ireland and England by the prophet Jeremiah.
