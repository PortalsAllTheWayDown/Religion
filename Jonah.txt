Jonah 4:1 - But it displeased Jonah that the city of Nineveh listened and repented of their evils before God. So God decided to not destroy Nineveh.
Nineveh was an enemy to Israel. God caused a gourd to come and protect Jonah from the sun and then God had a worm eat and kill the gourd. Jonah became angry because of this.
God spoke to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? You did not labour for it and make it to grow, it did come up in a night and perish in a night, and should i not spare Nineveh wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand.
